	of CO2-emissions from the oil and gas industry to the nationalAbstract

	Increasing fuel cost and concern regarding emissions have increased
	from 35 to 42 mill tonnes1. In the same period the
	
	
	incurred focus on energy conservation on offshore oil and gas contribution
	from the offshore oil and gas industry has
	
	
	installations. On the Norwegian continental shelf there has increased
	from approx. 20% to 22%. 80% of the offshore
	
	
	been an increased commercial value of natural gas and a CO2- emissions
	comes from roughly 250 gas turbines installed to
	
	
	tax on fuel consumption the last 10 years. For the time being produce
	electricity or drive compressors and pumps directly.
	
	
	the alternative value of natural gas is in the range 0 to 0.08 The
	remaining emissions offshore come from flaring. The
	
	
	EUR/Sm3 and consumption of fuel is taxed with approx. 0.1 increase
	in emissions has caused a considerable pressure to
	
	
	EUR/Sm3 burned. This has brought forward significant develop technology
	to reduce this trend of increased CO2-
	
	
	changes in operational procedures and technology emissions.
	
	
	development on the Norwegian oil and gas installations There have
	been two approaches to the scheme of limiting
	
	
	compared to installations in other oil and gas regions the CO2-emissions:
	
	
	throughout the world. Focus has increased on keeping the
	
	
	power requirement down, avoiding unnecessary fuel
	
	
	
	- CO2-clensing and deposition
	
	
	consumption and designing more energy efficient systems.
	
	
	
	- Improved energy conservation
	
	
	The most efficient way of achieving this is by installing cold
	
	
	process flares and steam cycles on existing or new gas turbines
	
	
	to form Combined Cycles ( Although there has been several high profiled
	R&DCC). In Norway three steam cycle projects regarding CO2-clensing
	and deposition, the concept ofplants fueled by gas turbine exhaust
	are under completion on improved energy conservation has been the
	only practical
	
	
	offshore oil and gas installations. The overall electrical solution
	so far with one exception. So far none of the projects
	
	
	efficiency of these plants is around 50%. When steam is involving
	CO2-clensing of exhaust gases have been
	
	
	extracted for process heat the overall thermal efficiency is implemented.
	However, due to the natural gas specification for
	
	
	higher. Compared to conventional simple cycles the combined Statoil’s
	Sleipner field, the CO2 extracted from the natural gas
	
	
	cycle reduces consumption of fuel gas and emissions of CO2 is reinjected
	in geological formations instead of venting it to
	
	
	and NOX with minimum 25%. When designed as alternative to the atmosphere.
	The CO2-extraction is done with a
	
	
	conventional simple cycle solutions, a combined cycle conventional
	absorption plant at elevated pressures and is not
